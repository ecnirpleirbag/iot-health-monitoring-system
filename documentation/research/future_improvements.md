# Future Improvements

The current version of the IoT-Enabled Non-Invasive Blood Pressure and Vital Signs Monitoring System serves as a proof-of-concept and functional prototype. Several enhancements are planned for future iterations:

## 1. Enhanced Accuracy
- Implement advanced calibration methods using machine learning to improve accuracy of PTT-based blood pressure estimation.
- Use of higher-precision ECG and PPG sensors.

## 2. Edge AI Integration
- Incorporate TinyML models on the ESP32 or Raspberry Pi for on-device health anomaly detection.
- Real-time inference for irregular heartbeat, high/low BP alerts, etc.

## 3. Cloud-Based Analytics
- Integrate with platforms like AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT Core, or Azure IoT Hub.
- Enable long-term data storage and trend analysis.

## 4. Mobile App Expansion
- Add patient profile management.
- Include live tracking, push notifications, and telemedicine integration.

## 5. Power Optimization
- Implement deep sleep and efficient communication protocols (e.g., MQTT over WiFi/BLE).
- Use solar power or kinetic charging for remote healthcare settings.

## 6. Regulatory Compliance
- Work towards certifications (e.g., FDA, ISO 13485) for real-world deployment in healthcare environments.

## 7. Modular Hardware Design
- Develop plug-and-play sensor modules to make the system customizable and serviceable.
