# Literature Review

## Introduction
This literature review explores existing approaches and technologies for non-invasive vital signs monitoring, with a special focus on Pulse Transit Time (PTT) for blood pressure estimation.

## 1. Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring
- Traditional methods include cuff-based oscillometric and auscultatory methods.
- Recent studies (e.g., Mukkamala et al., 2015) have proposed PTT-based estimation as an alternative for continuous, non-invasive monitoring.

## 2. Pulse Transit Time (PTT)
- Defined as the time difference between the R-wave peak in the ECG and the corresponding peak in the PPG signal.
- Multiple works (Liu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) validate its inverse relationship with systolic BP.

## 3. IoT in Healthcare
- IoT-based health monitoring is gaining traction for its real-time data acquisition, remote tracking, and smart alerting.
- Notable systems: AliveCor, Qardio, and Omron HeartGuide.

## 4. Wearable Sensors
- Comparison of ECG, PPG, temperature, and pressure sensors used in real-time systems.
- Key trade-offs: power, accuracy, form factor, and cost.

## 5. Limitations of Existing Systems
- High cost, poor calibration, and lack of personalization.
- Minimal cloud integration and absence of intelligent alerting in many commercial systems.

## Conclusion
This project builds upon past research and addresses gaps by integrating PTT, IoT, cloud, and edge AI into a single, affordable prototype.
