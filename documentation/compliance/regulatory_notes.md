# 📋 Regulatory Notes

The IoT-Based Health Monitoring System is currently a **non-certified prototype** and does **not comply with medical device regulations** such as FDA, CE, or ISO 13485.

## ⚙️ Regulatory Status

| Region       | Certification Required | Status          |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| United States| FDA Class II           | Not certified   |
| European Union | CE Mark (MDD/MDR)    | Not certified   |
| India         | CDSCO (Class B)       | Not certified   |

## 🔍 Future Certification Considerations

To pursue regulatory approval in the future, the following areas must be addressed:

- **Clinical Validation**: Controlled trials comparing device data against certified clinical devices.
- **Quality Management System**: Implementation of ISO 13485-compliant processes.
- **Risk Management**: IEC 60601 and ISO 14971 adherence.
- **Documentation**: Design history file (DHF), device master record (DMR), and test reports.

Until these steps are fulfilled, the system remains for **non-commercial and research use only**.
